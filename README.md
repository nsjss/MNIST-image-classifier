# MNIST Neural Network from Scratch

# Overview

This project implements a fully connected neural network from scratch (without using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

The goal is to gain a deep understanding of forward propagation, backpropagation, weight updates, and optimization techniques in neural networks.

# Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each 28×28 pixels in grayscale, representing digits from 0 to 9.
